# First-Projects
These are my project from a journey of learning Python as my first language.

I have created this Tic Tac Toe game with python and tkinter library after a Udemy course 'Zero to Hero Python Bootcamp' by Jose Portilla. 

Without any previous coding experience. 

I would appreciate constructive critics, and any advises how to approach coding from now. 

I still didn't decided what to specialize in, but most likely it will be Full Stack Web Development.
